## Project Quality Management

Welcome new project managers to another stage in agile project management. The new stage that you will be learning here is project quality management and it might be harder to measure what is quality in a project. You might think of beautiful designs or numerous usable functions that would make the project a success but I think we are getting a little ahead of ourselves. Remember the purpose of project management is to meet or surpass the expectations of stakeholders for a project and that could come in many different ways, and this is where quality is determined. Another way of looking at this is the surplus of productive hours to create a product or deliverable that will leave your investors stunned. 

Project quality management is vague or uncertain compared to the other project management processes because there really is no defined measure other than satisfying the purpose of the project. Then the question becomes what defines quality in a project? As a project manager the quality in a project should be based on the customer expectations and requirements and not solely based on the written requirements.  The leading cause for projects failing regarding quality is the project team focuses on the written requirements and not really meet other requirements that stakeholders need or require.
