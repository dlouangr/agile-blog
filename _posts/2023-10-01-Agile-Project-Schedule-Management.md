Welcome to the world of agile project schedule management! If you are new to Agile, you are in for a treat. Agile is a project management framework that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and is customer-centered. In this blog post we are going to go over what is project schedule management and the tutorials and materials that could aid you in your journey to a successful project.

## What is Project Schedule Management?

Project Schedule Management is the processes required to make sure the project is completed in a timely manner. Think of it as the steps you need to take in order for your planned trip or adventure be as smooth as possible with as little bumps as possible. 

1. **Planning Schedule Management**: Think of this as setting up the game plan for your project's schedule. You decide how you'll keep track of time, who's responsible for what, and how you'll know if you're on schedule.
2. **Defining Activities**: Imagine you're planning a road trip. Defining activities is like making a list of all the tasks you need to do before you hit the road: pack, get the car serviced, buy snacks, etc.
3. **Sequencing Activities**: Now, you figure out the order in which these tasks need to be done. You can't buy snacks before you pack, right? Sequencing activities is like putting tasks in a logical order.
4. **Estimating Activity Durations**: Here, you make educated guesses about how long each task will take. For instance, you might estimate that packing will take an hour, and getting the car serviced will take two hours.
5. **Develop the Schedule**: Using your task list and time estimates, you create a timetable for your road trip. You figure out when you'll start, how long each task will take, and when you'll arrive at your destination.
6. **Control Schedule**: Once you're on the road, you need to make sure you stick to your schedule. If you hit traffic or decide to stop for an unplanned lunch, you might need to adjust your plan to stay on track.

In essence, project schedule management is like planning a road trip. You start by making a plan, listing tasks, arranging them in order, estimating how long they'll take, creating a schedule, monitoring your progress, and adjusting as needed to reach your destination on time. It's all about keeping your project, or in this analogy, your road trip, on track.

Now in order for these things to come into fruition, we need to have the tools and materials for your road trip to be a success.
