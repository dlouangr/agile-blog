## Introduction

Welcome new project managers to another part of your Agile story. Today we will be exploring the importance of effective communications in project management that really bring about your project success. This will help differentiate you from the other project managers when everyone is so focused on bringing about results that will be beneficial for you in the long run. Of course all of this may seem easy at first, but as you start experiencing many conditions in a project you will start to realize that this may become one of those moments where it is easier than it sounds.

The workplace is very different to navigate and especially in a new setting that you are unfamilier. Thankfully you are not alone in this manner and we will help to clear away most misunderstandings to help you grow to become a successful project manager. Of course there are several factors you have to consider in a project. We are break down some of the most common issues that will arise during this stage and the importance of it later on. 

## Planning Effective Communication 

1. **Individual and Group Communication**: Most managers think that adding more people in a project will solve your problems, however, that is not the case and will in fact increase the failure rate of your project. There is more thinking that needs to go into communicating with a group of people or even individuals than emailing everyone or holding a virtual meeting. The most efficient way to communicate with a group may be through face-to-face meetings, some virtual, one-on-one or even through an email. Everyone is different and everyone is gonna have to work together to see what method of communication will work best for each other.

2. **Formal and Informal methods of Communicating**: Knowing how to develop relationships between team members will be crucial for a project success and how to navigate between informal and formal communication will help you get there. While formal communication will be good for project documentation, in the settign where you are trying to build a team that works well together, formal methods of communication will help build bridges and get everyone on the same page faster compared to reading detailed reports or emails that can be confusing for those not in the same field.

3. **Distributing Information in a Timely and Efficient Manner**:
