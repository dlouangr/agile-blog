Procurement is receiving outside services or goods from outside sources. Since, there is no place in the world where everything is located and is available for everyday use. It is basically a requirement for all companies or businesses to receive some sort of outside service of goods in order for the company to run efficiently. Since not all companies are able to sustain themselves with their own resources, it is important that you understand what are the resources that you need and how you are supposed to get them.

## Common Pitfalls and Challenges

1.**Not Negotiating**: There a few things to consider before you start negotiating with your sellers and thats to make sure that when you are negotiating you are doing it in a way to benefit both parties and not one-sidedly gaining all the benefits. The point of negotiating with a seller that you plan on having a long-term partnership is to help each other out. 

2.**Ignoring Your Suppliers**: When you decide on having the minimum amount of communication with your suppliers or service providers you are missing out on a great opportunity to make great deals with those outside your organizatoin. It would be for your benefit to continue having friendly relationship with your suppliers whether they are your short-term, one-time, or long-term suppliers. They are your key resource for information about possible good deals, information on resources, and testing new products.
