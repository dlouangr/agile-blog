## Project Risk Management

Another day, another moment in time where we learn another wonder of project management. This post is another page in Agile with project risk management.

The major downside in not identifying risks is a huge loss in funds or effort that was put into the project and which could later cascade into investors pulling their funds or canceling the project. This is harmful both to you and the company, which leads to the question: how can you identify risks that you don't know exist?

There are a variety of identifying risk techniques that have been used over the years with the most common being: brainstorming, SWOT analysis, root cause analysis, Delphi technique, interviewing, inspections, and affinity diagram.
