As a project manager, you have a responsibility to collaborate with your stakeholders to understand what are the scope and constraints 
of the project for yourself and your team. Being able to get all the information you need from the stakeholders is important to create
a clear and concise scopes and constraints for your project. This blog post will be going into the benefits of having a well-defined scopes
and constraints for your project and what effective strategies will help you accomplish this task.

## Project Scope Management

Project Scope Management is the multiple processes involved when you meet with stakeholders to define what the project is going to be 
about, what are the unique features, what should it not include, and other features that the stakeholders would want from the project.

## The Significance of Defining Project Scope and Constraints:

1. **Clarity and Alignment**: By defining the project scope, you make sure that everyone who is a part of the project are on the same 
page about the requirements of the project, what is its purpose, what will the project do, the features that make the project unique, 
among other expectations about the project. This is one of the processes that a project manager will need to go through so the team 
won't have misunderstandings or experience scope creep.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: Projects are constrained by scope, time, and cost and if it is not clearly defined in the beginning it will 
result in complications further down the road that can result in projects being canceled. Statistically speaking, almost half of all 
projects made in one year alone was canceled by teams unable to be within the constraints of their projects, sponsors canceling their 
funding for the project, time constraint was not met, and other reasons.[1] Given these reasons, it is important to define your constraints
so you can develop risk mitigation tactics and develop strategies to keep your project within your constraints.

3. **Resource Optimization**: Combining these two definitions for your projects allows you to distribute your resources efficiently. This 
results in personnel used in a optimized fashion to complete their tasks, clear view on the spending for your project, and the correct 
tools or technology needed for your project goals.

As you can see, defining the project scope and constraint gives your team and you as a project manager a clear understanding on how you
should proceed with the project to complete your stakeholders requirements. Personally, getting the information required to begin the 
project cannot be done in a day, nor is it recommended, as various amounts of time and effort is required to complete each project. Each 
projects are unique in their purpose, features, and audience they are trying to reach. Although it may seem efficient to complete your 
project goals as fast as possible, it will only leave complications in the future if the project constraints and scope are not defined 
clearly.

##The Best Practices for Defining Project Scope and Constraints
1. **Engage with Stakeholders**: Extensive discussion is required during all the processed of project scope management between you and 
your team with your client, company, or other various organizations that will become a part of your project. The project is for your 
client and if their needs cannot be met will result in the contract termination between your company and client.
