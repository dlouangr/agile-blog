As a project manager, you have a responsibility to collaborate with your stakeholders to understand what are the scope and constraints 
of the project for yourself and your team. Being able to get all the information you need from the stakeholders is important to create
a clear and concise scope and constraint for your project. This blog post will be going into the benefits of having a well-defined scopes
and constraints for your project and what effective strategies will help you accomplish this task.

## Project Scope Management

Project Scope Management is the multiple processes involved when you meet with stakeholders to define what the project is going to be 
about, what are the unique features, what should it not include, among other features that the stakeholders would want from the project.

## The Significance of Defining Project Scope and Constraints:

1. **Clarity and Alignment**: By defining the project scope, you make sure that everyone who is a part of the project are on the same 
page about the requirements of the project, what is its purpose, what will the project do, the features that make the project unique, 
among other expectations about the project. This is one of the processes that a project manager will need to go through so the team 
won't have misunderstandings or experience scope creep.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: Projects are constrained by scope, time, and cost and if it is not clearly defined in the beginning it will 
result in complications further down the road that can result in projects being canceled. Statistically speaking, almost half of all 
projects made in one year alone was canceled by teams unable to be within the constraints of their projects, sponsors canceling their 
funding for the project, time constraint was not met, and other reasons.[1] Given these reasons, it is important to define your constraints
so you can develop risk mitigation tactics and develop strategies to keep your project within your constraints.

3. **Resource Optimization**: Combining these two definitions for your projects allows you to dsitribute your resources efficiently. This 
results in personnel used in a optimized fashion to complete their tasks, clear view on the spending for your project, and the correct 
tools or technology needed for your project.
