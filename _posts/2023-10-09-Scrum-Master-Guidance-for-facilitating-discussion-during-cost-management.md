## Introduction

Welcome, new scrum masters, on your journey to the world of Agile and the increasing complexity and simplicity of agile projects. We have some good news to share with you and it's that the world of Agile is much simpler than you could imagine. Of course, it might feel overwhelming with the vast amount of information and resources that you can find on the Internet, but to not waste your time and our efforts we will try to help you in facilitating cost management meetings and the impacts it can have on cost management. 

## What is Project Cost Management?

Well to begin your journey in Project Cost Management, you need to know what is project cost management and the processes. This is your baby steps before you can sprint in project management. Project cost management is the processes involved for planning and defining the project costs within budget. Now the budget can be defined by the product owner, business owner, or stakeholders when you are meeting with them.

## Project Cost Management Processes: 

1.**Planning cost management**: involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost. The main output of this process is a cost management plan[^3]. The beginning of most Agile project management processes start with documenting and defining what are the requirements and tasks that need to be completed in order for the project to become a success to the product owner. This process is in order for everyone to be on the same page and give their opinions on what they think the cost would be for materials, time, services, software, everything that could effect the project cost. 

2. **Estimating costs**: involves developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to complete a project. The main outputs of the cost estimating process are activity cost estimates, basis of estimates, and project documents updates[^3]. This is the tricky part in estimating costs because it could be specific cost for a single software or as broad and general depending on the project management. The problem that often comes up during these parts is when the project manager underestimates the cost it would take for a task to be completed or parts of a project to be completed with the resources given. This is one of the many factors that could affect the cost of a project and something to keep in mind on your Agile project journey.

3. **Determining the budget**: involves allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance. The main outputs of the cost budgeting process are a cost baseline, project funding requirements, and project documents updates[^3]. These documents will be coming from the higher-ups, the people who are in charge of the business or company, they will decide how much resources they are willing to provide and a way for them to see who is performing well with the given tasks they are provided with.

4. **Controlling costs**: involves controlling changes to the project budget. The main outputs of the cost control process are work performance information, cost forecasts, change requests, and project management plan updates, and project documents updates[^3]. This is something you need to address during every discussion, to be sure that everyone is doing the task that is assigned to them and helps you keep track if you are on track to completing your project within the provided time.
