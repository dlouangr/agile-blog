## Project Resource Management

Welcome new agile project managers to another chapter in your agile journey. We are going to be learning about project resource management and what tools we can provide you with to help you on your journey. The earth that we know was originally full of life and a variety of resources that covered the earths surface or buried beneath the earthen layers. These resources are finite and are of limited quantity, however, it is not as if these resources are not being discovered in other continents. Resources for your project in project management are humans and anything physical such as materials, technology, company facilities, and anything else that you would need to use.
