## Project Resource Management

Welcome new agile project managers to another chapter in your agile journey. We are going to be learning about project resource management and what tools we can provide you with to help you on your journey. The earth that we know was originally full of life and a variety of resources that covered the earth's surface or buried beneath the earth's layers. These resources are finite and are of limited quantity, however, it is not as if these resources are not being discovered in other continents. Resources for your project in project management are humans and anything physical such as materials, technology, company facilities, and anything else that you would need to use.

2. **Resource Conflict**: When two or more resources are required for different projects at the same time when it is limited in quantity or availability.

## Human Resource Conflicts

Resource conflicts can come from a variety of directions in your project and are equally overlooked until problems or issues arise, which is usually resulting from poor management[^1]. The most common resource conflict in today's world right now are human resources. Right now, you are seeing an over abundance of people in schools and classrooms who are understaffed or not being put in their proper role as a teacher or staff for the students to receive the proper education they need.

Education right now is an important factor in today's society and if it is not properly addressed the students will not be ready by the time they are applying for jobs in local, not to mention national or even international level careers. Now applying this sort of concept to project management with human resources. If your employees are not taken care of or are burned out from all the work that they are dumped with, a conflict will surely arise and may result in a project being canceled or rumors that could affect your company's reputation.
