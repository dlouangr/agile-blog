## Project Resource Management

Welcome new agile project managers to another chapter in your agile journey. We are going to be learning about project resource management and what tools we can provide you with to help you on your journey. The earth that we know was originally full of life and a variety of resources that covered the earth's surface or buried beneath the earth's layers. These resources are finite and are of limited quantity, however, it is not as if these resources are not being discovered in other continents. Resources for your project in project management are humans and anything physical such as materials, technology, company facilities, and anything else that you would need to use.

## Definition
1. **Project resource management**: involves the process of using human and phyiscal resources efficiently for a project.

2. **Resource Conflict**: When two or more resources are required for different projects at the same time when it is limited in quantity or availability.

## Human Resource Conflicts

Resource conflicts can come from a variety of directions in your project and are equally overlooked until problems or issues arise, which is usually resulting from poor management[^1]. The most common resource conflict in today's world right now are human resources. Right now, you are seeing an over abundance of people in schools and classrooms who are understaffed or not being put in their proper role as a teacher or staff for the students to receive the proper education they need.

Education right now is an important factor in today's society and if it is not properly addressed the students will not be ready by the time they are applying for jobs in local, not to mention national or even international level careers. Now applying this sort of concept to project management with human resources. If your employees are not taken care of or are burned out from all the work that they are dumped with, a conflict will surely arise and may result in a project being canceled or rumors that could affect your company's reputation.

## What tools can we use?

While there are not that much tools available digitally to ensure perfect human resource management, there are ways as a project manager that you can do to help resolve conflict. 

1. **Confrontation**: As a project manager, you'll often encounter conflicts that need direct addressing. In the confrontation mode, you approach the conflict head-on, using problem-solving techniques to help all parties involved work through their disagreements. This mode is highly effective when both the task at hand and the relationship among team members are of great importance to the success of the project. It ensures that issues are resolved while maintaining a positive team dynamic.
   
2. **Compromise**: Conflict resolution sometimes involves finding middle ground. In the compromise mode, project managers use a give-and-take approach. They engage in negotiations and seek solutions that provide some degree of satisfaction to all parties in the dispute. This mode works best when both the task and the relationship among team members hold moderate importance, allowing for a balanced resolution that satisfies everyone involved.
   
3. **Smoothing**: In certain situations, it may be beneficial to downplay differences and emphasize areas of agreement. This approach, known as smoothing or accommodating, is useful when the relationship among team members is of high importance, while the task's importance is relatively low. Smoothing aims to maintain a positive working relationship even if the project's specific goals are not the primary focus.
   
4. **Forcing**: The forcing mode involves taking a win/lose approach to conflict resolution. Project managers assert their viewpoint, often at the potential expense of another party's perspective. This mode, sometimes referred to as directing, is particularly effective when the task is of high importance, and the relationship among team members holds less significance. It may be necessary to ensure that essential project goals are met.
   
5. **Withdrawal**: At times, it's tempting to avoid or withdraw from conflicts. The withdrawal mode, also called avoiding, is generally the least desirable method for handling conflicts. It should be used sparingly, primarily when both the task and the relationship among team members are of low importance. Avoiding conflicts can be counterproductive in many situations, as it doesn't lead to resolution and can hinder progress.

6. **Collaborating**: Collaboration is an approach where decision-makers gather various viewpoints and insights to reach a consensus. Even if team members don't entirely agree on a decision, they commit to follow it in the best interests of the organization. The collaborating mode promotes inclusivity and cooperation, making it a valuable approach for complex projects and when maintaining a positive team dynamic is essential.

These are some of the tools you can use as a project manager to resolve conflicts between human resources on any levels of authority between you and others if you choose too.
