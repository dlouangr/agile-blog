## Project Resource Management

Welcome new agile project managers to another chapter in your agile journey. We are going to be learning about project resource management and what tools we can provide you with to help you on your journey. The earth that we know was originally full of life and a variety of resources that covered the earth's surface or buried beneath the earth's layers. These resources are finite and are of limited quantity, however, it is not as if these resources are not being discovered in other continents. Resources for your project in project management are humans and anything physical such as materials, technology, company facilities, and anything else that you would need to use.

## Definition
1. **Project resource management**: involves the process of using human and phyiscal resources efficiently for a project.

2. **Resource Conflict**: When two or more resources are required for different projects at the same time when it is limited in quantity or availability.

## Human Resource Conflicts

Resource conflicts can come from a variety of directions in your project and are equally overlooked until problems or issues arise, which is usually resulting from poor management[^1]. The most common resource conflict in today's world right now are human resources. Right now, you are seeing an over abundance of people in schools and classrooms who are understaffed or not being put in their proper role as a teacher or staff for the students to receive the proper education they need.

Education right now is an important factor in today's society and if it is not properly addressed the students will not be ready by the time they are applying for jobs in local, not to mention national or even international level careers. Now applying this sort of concept to project management with human resources. If your employees are not taken care of or are burned out from all the work that they are dumped with, a conflict will surely arise and may result in a project being canceled or rumors that could affect your company's reputation.

## What tools can we use?

While there are not that much tools available digitally to ensure perfect human resource management, there are ways as a project manager that you can do to help resolve conflict. 

1. **Confrontation**: When using the confrontation mode, project managers face a conflict directly using a problem-solving approach that allows affected parties to work through their disagreements. This approach is also called the problem-solving mode or win/win using Covey’s terminology. When the task and relationship are both of high importance, this mode is usually the most effective.
   
2. **Compromise**: With the compromise mode, project managers use a give-and-take approach to resolving conflicts. They bargain and search for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all the parties in a dispute. Some people refer to it as reconciliation. This mode works best when both the task and the relationship are of medium importance.
   
3. **Smoothing**: When using the smoothing mode, the project manager deemphasizes or avoids areas of differences and emphasizes areas of agreement. This approach is also called accommodating, and it is best used when the relationship is of high importance and the task is of low importance.
   
4. **Forcing**: The forcing mode can be viewed as the win/lose approach to conflict resolution. Project managers exert their viewpoint at the potential expense of another viewpoint. Some people refer to it as directing. If the task is of high importance and the relationship is of low importance, this mode can be very effective.
   
5. **Withdrawal**: When using the withdrawal mode, project managers retreat or withdraw from an actual or potential disagreement. This
approach is also called avoiding, and is normally the least desirable conflict-handling mode, unless the task and the relationship are both of low importance.

6. **Collaborating**: Using the collaborating mode, decision makers incorporate different viewpoints and insights to develop consensus and commitment. Even though managers might not agree on a decision, they commit to following it in the best interests of the organization.
