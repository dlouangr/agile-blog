If you are struggling to understand the agile development process, whether it may be one step or the whole entire process. You have come to the right place. This post is going to be about the principles behind the agile process in project management and hopefully give you some better clarity on why we have these principles. 

## First Principle: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Now you may be considering why we need to consider our customers as the first priority when you are developing a project? Well, the primary reason you are developing projects or managing a project is because it is for your customer or supervisor. You are developing something that is going to affect at the minimum of one live to the maximum of the world population. The potential is there and in order for the project reach others beyond the intended scope you are able to satisfy the customer who ordered the project. By continuous feedback from the customer, the sooner you will be able to satisfy customer demands and receive your ROI (return on investments).

## Second Principle: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
