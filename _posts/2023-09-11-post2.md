If you are struggling to understand the agile development process, whether it may be one step or the whole entire process. You have come to the right place. This post is going to go into the principles of agile methodology in project management and hopefully give you some better clarity on why we have these principles. 

## First Principle: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Now you may be considering why we need to consider our customers as the first priority when you are developing a project? Well, the primary reason you are developing projects or managing a project is because it is for your customer or supervisor. You are developing something that is going to affect at the minimum of one life to the maximum of the world population. The potential is there and in order for the project to reach others beyond the intended scope you are able to satisfy the customer who ordered the project. By continuous feedback from the customer, the sooner you will be able to satisfy customer demands and receive your ROI (return on investments).

## Second Principle: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Agile developers must get into the mindset that change is always welcome in even the later parts of the project development. Most traditional companies see it as a downside, but they are missing the point that the changes the customer want to make will benefit them and will give them an advantage against their competitors. Which ties back to the first principle that your highest priority should be to satisfy your customer.

## Third Principle: Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
